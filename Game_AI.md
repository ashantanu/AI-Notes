**Resources**
paper[https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AIIDE/article/view/5217/5073]

**Top Advantages**
* Quantitative metric to measure the 'interestingness' of text.

**New Things**
* A metric for measuring interestingness of text. Measures predictive inference caused by *foreshadowing* in text.
* Uses word vectors and cosine similiarities in an ionteresting way

**Model Summary**

**Notable Insights**
Using 1x1 conv to speed up convolutions. Check [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/194142/what-does-1x1-convolution-mean-in-a-neural-network#:~:text=A%201x1%20convolution%20simply%20maps,volumes%20with%20extremely%20large%20depths.)

**Misc things**
* Very good related work/intro section. Nicely covers some cognitive science concepts for texts.

**limitations**
* I didn't find the results persuasive enough. Plus the survey to test results were very limited in terms of quantity.
