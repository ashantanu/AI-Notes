# Notes Repository
Notes on below items:
* NLP
    * NN for NLP
    * You should also refer to Stanford NLP notes (latest course version)

Will be adding more notes and links to useful notes as well.

### Note:
These notes were written using Markdown+Maths extension in VSCode. I have converted them into HTML for proper formatting. Feel free to convert to pdf.

I also hope to add a script for converting the markdown to HTML to make things easier to edit.
